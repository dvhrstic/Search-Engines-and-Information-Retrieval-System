QUERY_ID = 1, DOC_ID = MattHh.f, RELEVANCE_SCORE = 1
--> Reason for grading them with 1: For the query "graduate program mathematics" one may also think about the person who graduates program methematics and because the documents had information about the ex-students in the field of Mathematics the document ay be partially relevant.

QUERY_ID = 1, DOC_ID = Statistics.f, RELEVANCE_SCORE = 2
--> Here the field of statistics is explained and statistics is related to the mathematics and therefore the grade 2.

Precision = 7 / 22 ~ 0.31
Recall = 7 / 100 ~ 0.07
